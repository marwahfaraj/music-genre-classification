# 🎵 Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning to classify music tracks by genre using audio features derived from Spotify’s metadata. It is part of the final project for the **ADS 504 - Applied Machine Learning** course.

All analysis was conducted in **Google Colab** due to dataset size and compute resource constraints.
